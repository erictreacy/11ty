Hi, I'm Eric.

I'm a chemist currently living in Marquette, Michigan working at a chemical compounding lab.
I used to build software and decided to take a break from the professional dev life to focus on a field that
allows me more time with my family, friends and self. I love science and technology and this is my internet tendency.

You can follow me on [GitHub](https://github.com/erictreacy) or read my [writing](/writing/) for extemporaneous output.
I don't use social media all that much so, you would have a better chance finding me in the woods of Michigan's Upper Peninsula
... or just [email me](mailto:mail@etreacy.me) &mdash; I'd prefer that.

My knowledge ranges from bench science to software development:

<i>From 2008 - 2015</i>, I oscillated my time between [National Jewish Health](https://www.nationaljewish.org/home) and [The University of Colorado &mdash; Anschutz Medical Campus](https://www.cuanschutz.edu/)
researching the Life Sciences in Pediatric Rheumatology, Immunology & Cell Biology with [Philippa Marrack, PhD, FRS](https://www.nationaljewish.org/doctors-departments/providers/researchers/philippa-marrack) and
[Leonard Dragone, MD, PhD](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leonard-dragone-94125474/), et al.

<i>From 2014 - current</i>, I work(ed) in Software Development for [The Texas Medical Association](https://www.texmed.org/), [Xeratec Corporation](https://xeratec.com/) and [Baby E's BBQ](https://babyesbbq.com) &mdash; and continue to
create and contribute to OSS for kicks &mdash; plus, I like the community there &mdash; it keeps me up-to-date and most of the people are kind and encouraging.

I also have a handful of [publications](/writing/2019/06/18) that I have contributed to.

[Here's more](https://linkedin.com/in/erictreacy) if you're truly interested.

Outside of work, I spend my time with my family and friends playing outdoors. I enjoy reading and keep
a log of the recent [books](/reading/) I've enjoyed &mdash; I don't bother posting the ones that I didn't care for.

I enjoy designing with code and programming &mdash; and this space is my creative outlet. I engineer with code using various web technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Ruby on Rails, ASP.Net, etc. &mdash; pretty much anything that will get me to where I want to be &mdash; I am always learning and
discovering.
