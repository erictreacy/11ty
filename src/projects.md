# Projects


> It's not uncommon for the skills that you develop on individual projects to
have broader applications. I spend most of my days in the laboratory, but
I also devote time to work on side projects. This page serves as a
place to put some of my more recent ones.


**My Ruby Notes** <br>
[My Ruby notes project (WIP)](//ruby.etreacy.me) is my [goal for the year 2021](/writing/2020/12/22) to study more about the Ruby programming language. This
site will serve as my place to put such things including examples and side projects. [Visit the site](//ruby.etreacy.me).



**Beyond Use Date (BUD)**<br>
[Beyond Use Date (WIP)](//bud.etreacy.me) is a tool that helps calcualte the date or time after which a compounded sterile preparation (CSP) or compounded nonsterile preparation (CNSP) may *not* be stored or transported and are calculated from the date or time of compounding. I use it in my lab daily. [Visit the site](//bud.etreacy.me).



 **Music Fun**<br> 
[Music for fun](https://music-fun.vercel.app/) is a for fun [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) work-in-progress containing the top-10 music albums that influenced my youth and beyond. Each album is linked to Spotify. [Visit the site](https://music-fun.vercel.app/).



**Mimic.css** <br>
[Mimic.css](https://erictreacy.github.io/mimic.css) is a ~~cross-browser~~ tongue-n-cheek
CSS animation library for chaff animation in websites and web applications.

**Vector Field** <br>
[Vector Field](https://vectorfield.etreacy.me) is an experiment to try and recapitulate Google's Material Design
graphics that they had back when [P5.js](https://p5js.org/) was starting to come around. [Visit the site](https://vectorfield.etreacy.me).



**Baby E's BBQ** <br>
[Baby E's BBQ](//babyesbbq.com) is project that I worked on with
the well known Graphic Designer [Gene Ullery-Smith](http://www.ullerysmith.com/).
